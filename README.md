## Introduction
This project is part of the Qiskit Fall Fest hackathon hosted by Yale, aiming to explore and solve quantum computing tasks using Qiskit. The hackathon includes three structured notebook tasks and one open task, all focused on advancing skills in quantum programming and understanding quantum algorithms.

## Project Structure
- **Task 1**: Description of the first notebook task.
- **Task 2**: Description of the second notebook task.
- **Task 3**: Description of the third notebook task.
- **Open Task**: Details about the open-ended task, exploring [specific quantum topic or challenge].

All tasks are in Jupyter Notebooks under the `notebooks/` directory for easy access and execution.

## Installation
To run the notebooks locally, you need:
1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Qiskit** installed (`pip install qiskit`)

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder.
2. Open any notebook and run cells in sequence.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to **Qiskit** for providing resources and to **Yale** for organizing the Fall Fest hackathon. Qiskit resources, documentation, and tutorials were invaluable to the completion of these tasks.
